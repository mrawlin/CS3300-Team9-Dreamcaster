Feature: Up/Down Vote
  As a user.
  I want to up/down vote a dream based on itâ€™s quality and/or my interest in it.
  So that I can help the community with content quality control.

  Scenario: See Ratings for Dreams
    Given the following dreams exist:
    | title  | text     |
    | title1 | text1    |
    | title2 | text2    |

    And I am on the home page

    Then I should see "Rating:"
    Then I should see "0" before "0"
    And I should see "0" before "title1"  
    And I should see "0" before "0"
    And I should see "0" before "title2"
