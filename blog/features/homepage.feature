Feature: display list of the dreams

     As a developer
     So users can browse the list of dreams
     I want to see dreams posted by users


Background: dreams have been added to the database
   
    Given the following dreams exist:

   |title                |text             |
   | Nightmare, Falling  | I fell off of a skyscraper towards earth. I tried to fly but failed. Woke up right before I hit the ground. |
   | Confusing, Lost     | I was lost in this fog forever, screaming for anyone....until someone started chasing me |
   | Weird, Clown        | I was a clown at my little brothers birthday. He and his friends were laughing at me when I noticed I was naked. |



   And I am on the Dreams home page
